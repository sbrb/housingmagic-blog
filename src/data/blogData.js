        <br></br>a) High Rental Yields: Mumbai's constant influx of migrants and

        increase property values in the surrounding areas.<br></br> <br></br>c)
        Limited Land Availability: Mumbai faces a scarcity of available land,
        leading to high demand and limited supply. As a result, property prices
        have historically shown an upward trend, making it an attractive
        long-term investment option.There is zero encroachment in Mumbai.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        <b>What is encroachment </b> <br></br> <br></br>
        In real estate, encroachment refers to a situation where a property
        owner's land extends beyond the legal boundaries and intrudes onto the
        neighboring property or public land. It occurs when a structure, such as
        a building, fence, wall, driveway, or any part of the property, is built
        or placed on another person's land without permission or legal right.
        Encroachment can happen unintentionally due to errors in land surveys,
        inaccurate property descriptions, or lack of awareness about property
        boundaries. It can also occur intentionally, when a property owner
        purposefully builds or places structures on another person's land
        without obtaining proper permissions or easements. Encroachments can
        lead to disputes between neighboring property owners, as the
        encroached-upon party may seek to have the encroaching structure removed
        or may demand compensation for the use of their land. Resolving
        encroachment issues typically involves legal proceedings, negotiations,
        and potentially adjusting property boundaries through an agreement or a
        court decision. It is crucial for property owners to be aware of their
        property boundaries and obtain accurate surveys and legal advice when
        dealing with any construction or property development to avoid
        encroachment issues.<br></br>
        <br></br>
        <b>Conclusion: </b>
        <br></br>
        <br></br>Mumbai's real estate market is an exciting blend of luxury,
        diversity, and investment potential. Whether you are looking for a dream
        home, an investment property, or a vibrant lifestyle, Mumbai offers an
        array of options to suit your needs. However, it's crucial to conduct
        thorough research, engage with reputable developers or agents, and
        carefully evaluate your budget and preferences before making any real
        estate decisions. With the right approach, Mumbai can open doors to
        endless possibilities and a truly enriching urban experience.
